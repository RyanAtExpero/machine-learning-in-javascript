# Machine Learning In Javascript

Materials for the Machine Learning in Javascript Course by Expero inc

Presented at the (Mcubed Machine Leanring Confernece, London, Oct 2017)[http://www.mcubed.london/sessions/workshop-introduction-to-machine-learning-with-javascript/]


## How to get setup for the course

### Part 1 - Jupyter Notebook Setup

The first part of the course will be run in Jupyter. Jupyter is a REPL like interface embedded in a
web page which is good for experimentation and exploratory development. Its a standard tool in python
for data science and well be using it with the Javascript kernel.

This means installing python ro run the nodebook and then the JS kernel and dependencies that we need.

 - Install an IPython distribution - Try (Anaconda)[] especially if you are interested in moving on to some the python tools after the conference
 - Install (node.js)[https://nodejs.org/en/] (v8.5.0 or later)
 - Install IJavascript kernel - `npm install -g ijavascript`
    - if you are running on linux check out the instructions on (this page)[http://n-riesco.github.io/ijavascript/doc/install.md.html]   
 - Install Javascript dependencies - `npm install` :)

### Part 2 - Deep learning & Neural Neworks

### Part 3 - Running Keras.js models in the browser
